# FRC2019
This pulls data down from thebluealliance and outputs several html files.
To run, use main.exe in ../dist/main
It will ask for an event id, input the id of the event you want to analyze

Examples of html output are in the 2019ksla and 2019casf folder.

Be sure to keep the js folder/file in the same relative path as the .exe. The html needs it.
../dist/main/main.exe
../dist/main/js/frc.js
