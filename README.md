# FRC2018
This pulls data down from thebluealliance and outputs several html files.
To run, use main.exe in ../dist/main
It will ask for an event id, input the id of the event you want to analyze, i.e. 2018week0 or 2018ndgf

Examples of html output are in the 2018week0 folder.

Be sure to keep the js folder/file in the same relative path as the .exe. The html needs it.
../dist/main/main.exe
../dist/main/js/frc.js
